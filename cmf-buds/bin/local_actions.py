"""Local actions for the CMF Buds.

The earbuds do not store arbitrary commands: the firmware only accepts a
fixed list of actions (play, next, volume, ANC...). What reaches the PC is
the *resulting action*, not the raw press.

That is why the macros are built on the PC:

* The daemon watches the earbuds' sink with ``pactl subscribe``. When the
  action picked on the earbud is "volume +/-" (for example the triple tap
  of the case button), the PC receives the AVRCP key and the sink volume
  changes on its own -> that change is the signal.
* The signals are grouped into multi-taps (double, triple...) with a time
  window.
* The modifier state (SUPER, CTRL, ALT, SHIFT) is read straight from
  /dev/input/event* so a rule can require "SUPER held".
* If a rule matches, the local command runs.
